# Getting familar with YU-component

I developed this little project to collect the refreshing and fantacy component during my postgraduate learing. 🤔️

You can find components such as:

* Particle animations using canvas; 🖼️
* Flowing card border component  accomplished by modern css; 💳
* ... (more features and functions are continuously injecting! )

# Instruction

### `npm install`

Install all dependencies used in this project.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes (well, not total hot reload).
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!
